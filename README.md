### An Analysis of Writing Skills in Machine Written Poetry by Case Study
#### Abstract 
The focus of this research stays between science and literature. Combination work of these two areas has not been done much in the past, and this fact makes this study more valuable. There are numbers of poems written by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that already passed the Turing test, but unlike other tasks done by machines, literature writing is more complicated than only getting a high score for being humanness. This paper aims to discover this complicated area by using literature elements. The emotional respond and overall well-shaped poem are not only about getting a high score for humanness, but other features also make a good poem. This paper was able to discover these elements. Started from the small details of looking through each line of the two lyrics, one written by a human and the other written by a machine. For the result, incomplete and confusing sentences helped to get positive reactions by making the readers able to fill in the gap with their thoughts, but it turned negative when the term became too vague. When it comes to the whole poem, the low score of humanness did not impact much on the overall poem, but the poem as a whole has to make the readers feel like it is written from a human to bring out an emotional response. This study also found that machine written poems already reached the level of human written versions. Although, AI written poems failed to get highly positive or profoundly negative values from the readers. Most of the readers spoke out the level of the poem was mediocre.
